# Classification of Mushrooms
Safe to eat or deadly poison?

# Attention
Because this research uses plotly to create it's graphs it could be that these graphs are not displayed. If that is the case please go to the following url: https://jandie.github.io/MushroomML/

Another way to solve this would be to run the entire jupyter notebook, but this would take several minutes if not longer to complete.

## Dataset and research question
With this dataset I would like to be able to make a model that can predict whether or not a mushroom is safe to eat. This should be determined using as little features as possible. Because this dataset has 22 features I would also like to find out if features are unnecessary. 

Research question: Which features are needed to determine whether or not a mushroom is safe to eat?

To be able to achieve this, all features need to be converted to numerical values. Then I would like to find out which features are less relevant. After that I want to try out different machine learning algorithms and find out which one is best fitted for the job.

Prediction: I expect that with this dataset a model could be made that can predict whether or not a mushroom is safe to eat with high accuracy.
